        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. <br>
            You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. <br>
            Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese, it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull. <br>
            Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.
